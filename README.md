## MEDICAL CHATBOT SYSTEM
A Medical-domain Dialogue System for Diseases Identification. Both the symptoms and the diseases are treated as slots as in the conventional dialogue systems. There is only one agent in the dialogue system, who is in charge of both symptom selection and disease prediction.
